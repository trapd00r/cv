## Currently

I work as support technician for the company Hemfixare during the
daytime and in the distribution business during the night shift.

I've been a CPAN author at [metacpan](https://metacpan.org/author/WOLDRICH) for
close to ten years and I indulge daily in the open source communities.

I write various pieces of texts for clients as a freelancer.

they're happy.

## Projects

### github

`2008-`
My [personal github account](https://github.com/trapd00r) hosts my hobby
development projects as well as listing contributions to open source
projects. Examples include: coloring libraries
[Term::ExtendedColor](https://github.com/trapd00r/Term-ExtendedColor) and
[File::LsColor](https://github.com/trapd00r/File-LsColor), as well as the most
feature-full mpd client that I know of ([pimpd2](https://github.com/trapd00r/pimpd2)).

### The CPAN
`2011-`
I've been an author on The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network for almost
a decade, and my [metacpan page](https://metacpan.org/author/WOLDRICH)
lists perl modules and distributions that I've written for others to
make use of when building their own programs, libraries and tools.


Being a CPAN author has taught me how to design a good interface for
other developers to make use of, the importance of backwards
compatibility and the need for a proper testsuite, among many other things.



### blog

`2011-`
I write down my thoughts on my technical blog at
[japh.se](http://japh.se) where I cover topics such as perl, linux,
command line tools and interesting discoveries I make.


### open source work

`2008-`
I've been present and engaging in a lot of open source communities
for the past 11 years. I indulge in IRC conversations in many
different channels on various topics, and many of my projects have been born out of
discussions there.
